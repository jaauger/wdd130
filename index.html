        <h2>Utah</h2>
        <img src="images/state-of-utah.jpg" alt="Canyonland National Park" width="200">>
        <p> Utah is a western U.S. state known for its striking natural landscapes, cultural heritage, and outdoor
            recreation. The state is home to vast deserts, rugged mountains, and the world-famous “Mighty 5” national
            parks.
            Each of these 5 parks showcase unique rock formations and dramatic scenery. Salt Lake City, the
            capital, lies near the Great Salt Lake and serves as a cultural and economic hub, with deep ties to the
            history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
            Utah’s diverse geography supports year-round activities such as skiing in the Wasatch Mountains,
            hiking through red rock canyons, and exploring expansive wilderness areas. Its combination of
            natural beauty, strong community traditions, and growing economy makes Utah a distinctive and dynamic place.
