            <p>Hello! My name is Jason Auger and I am from Riverton, Utah and I have lived here for the last 24
                years. Prior to living in Riverton, I grew up in the West Jordan Utah area. I enjoy being in the great
                outdoors and riding
                motorcycles and going to the beach when I travel and have the occasion to go. I am currently studing
                Software engineering at BYU Pathway and I am excited to achieve a bachelors degree in this field.

            <img src="images/state-of-utah.jpg" alt="Canyonland National Park" width="200">
            <p> Utah is a western U.S. state known for its striking natural landscapes, cultural heritage, and outdoor
                recreation. The state is home to vast deserts, rugged mountains, and the world-famous ‚ÄúMighty 5‚Äù
                national
                parks.
                Each of these 5 parks showcase unique rock formations and dramatic scenery. Salt Lake City, the
                capital, lies near the Great Salt Lake and serves as a cultural and economic hub, with deep ties to the
                history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
                Utah‚Äôs diverse geography supports year-round activities such as skiing in the Wasatch Mountains,
                hiking through red rock canyons, and exploring expansive wilderness areas. Its combination of
                natural beauty, strong community traditions, and growing economy makes Utah a distinctive and dynamic
                place.
